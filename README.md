# PyBer-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to find a way to analyze total weekly fares for each city type (urban, suburban, and rural). This information was gained through using two CSV files provided by PyBer. These files contained information about things such as total rides, drivers, and fares for each city type.

### Results
The graph below demonstrates a continuous discrepency among the monthly total fares by city type. Urban cities are consistently the most profitable while suburban cities remain the second most profitable, leaving rural cities as the least profitable. However, while the rural cities bring in the lowest total fares, it is worth noting that the table below illustrates that rural cities have the highest average fare per driver. In fact, the average fare per driver trend goes in the opposite direction of the total fares trend, along with the average fare per ride. Assumedly this has something to do with a lack of supply of drivers causing the fare per ride to increase. Finally, the rural and suburban cities have significantly fewer total rides when compared to urban cities, following the trend of them having fewer total drivers.

#### Summary
There are several recommendations that can be drawn from this analysis. For example, there's the option to slightly increase the amount of drivers present in rural and suburban cities. If there is enough demand to justify this change, the amount of drivers could be increased slightly and gradually. By increasing the amount of drivers present slowly over a period of time, there might be a way to inflate the amount of total rides without drastically decreasing the average fare per ride, thus creating a higher revenue for these cities. Additionally, given that there is clearly a high demand in urban cities, a marketing campaign could be used to increase the amount of total rides. Even utilizing a temporary discount on the average fare per ride could increase the number of total rides. This would create a larger base of customers for when the limited discount period fell off. Finally, a simpler suggestion would be to just increase the amount of total drivers present in all city types, particularly in urban cities. It would be beneficial to increase the total drivers, leading to an increase in total rides, and finally resulting in an increase in total fares accross all three city types.
