# PyBer-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to find a way to analyze total weekly fares for each city type (urban, suburban, and rural). This information was gained through using two CSV files provided by PyBer. These files contained information about things such as total rides, drivers, and fares for each city type.
### Results
The graph below demonstrates a continuous discrepency among the monthly total fares by city type. Urban cities are consistently the most profitable while suburban cities remain the second most profitable, leaving rural cities as the least profitable. However, while the rural cities bring in the lowest total fares, it is worth noting that the table below illustrates that rural cities have the highest average fare per driver. In fact, the average fare per driver trend goes in the opposite direction of the total fares trend, along with the average fare per ride. Assumedly this has something to do with a lack of supply of drivers causing the fare per ride to increase.
